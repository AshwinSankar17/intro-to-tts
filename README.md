# Intro to TTS 🗣️🔊

Welcome to the official repository for the **Intro to Text-to-Speech (TTS)** course! This beginner-friendly series is designed to build foundational knowledge in speech processing, audio fundamentals, and the pipeline behind modern TTS systems.

## 📚 Week 0: Foundations of Speech & Audio Processing

This week sets the stage for everything that follows. You'll explore the *physics* and *digital representation* of sound — the bedrock of TTS systems.

### Topics Covered:

1. **What is Sound?**

   * Nature of sound waves
   * Analog vs. digital representation
   * Visualizing waveforms

2. **Digital Audio Fundamentals**

   * **Amplitude**: What makes sound loud or soft
   * **Frequency**: Relation to pitch and tone
   * **Phase**: Wave alignment and interference
   * **Sampling Rate & Nyquist Theorem**: Discretizing sound for computers
   * **Fourier Transform & STFT**: Time-frequency analysis
   * **Spectrograms & Mel Spectrograms**: Visualizing frequency content
   * **MFCCs**: Compact representations of audio used in TTS
   * **Fundamental Frequency, Pitch, Energy, Loudness**
   * **SNR & SI-SDR**: Quality metrics in signal processing

3. **Hands-on Exercises**

   * Visualizing and playing audio
   * Listening to audio at different sampling rates
   * Understanding frequency/phase shifts through code
